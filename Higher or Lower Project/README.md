## Higher Lower Followers Game

A simple command-line game inspired by the "Higher Lower" concept. The player guesses which celebrity or entity has more social media followers, based on given descriptions.

## How It Works: -

1. The game randomly picks a person/entity from the data as Compare A.

2. Another person/entity is chosen as Against B.

3. You must guess who has more followers by typing A or B.

4. If you guess correctly, your score increases and the new "Compare A" becomes the previous winner.

5. The game continues until you guess incorrectly or no unique comparisons are left.

## Features: -

1. Prevents repeated comparisons in the same session.

2. Tracks and displays the current score.

3. Ends when all unique comparisons are exhausted or the player guesses incorrectly.
