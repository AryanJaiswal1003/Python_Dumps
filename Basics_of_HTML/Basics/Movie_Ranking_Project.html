<h1>Movie Reviews</h1>

<p>These are three of my all-time favorite movies. Each of them left a deep impact on me with their storytelling, visuals, and powerful themes. Below are my personal reviews, the most important scenes, and quotes that stuck with me.</p>

<h2>1. Interstellar (2014) - Directed by Christopher Nolan</h2>

<h3>Review:</h3>
<p>
  Interstellar is a visually breathtaking sci-fi epic that combines hard science with deep human emotion. It explores love, sacrifice, and the survival of humanity against the backdrop of space exploration. Nolan balances mind-bending relativity with a father's bond to his daughter, making it as emotional as it is intellectual.

<h5>Cooper in the Tesseract:</h5>
<p>The moment where Cooper communicates with Murph across time through the bookshelf, showing that love can transcend time and space.</p>

<h5>Quote:</h5>

<h2>2. Final Destination (2000) - Directed by James Wong</h2>

<h3>Review:</h3>
<p>
  Final Destination flips the horror genre by making Death itself the villain. Instead of a monster or killer, the characters try to outwit fate after narrowly escaping a plane crash. The suspense comes from elaborate chain-reaction death sequences that feel inevitable and terrifying.

<h4>Most Important Scene:</h4>
<h5>The Airplane Premonition:</h5>
<p>Alex's vision of the flight exploding sets the tone for the entire franchise.</p>

<h5>Quote:</h5>
<p>"Death doesn't like to be cheated."</p>

<h2>3. Inception (2010) - Directed by Christopher Nolan</h2>

<h3>Review:</h3>
<p>
  Inception is a masterclass in storytelling that combines action, philosophy, and dream logic. It explores the fragility of reality and the power of ideas while keeping audiences hooked with stunning visuals and a multilayered narrative structure. It's a rare blockbuster that challenges the mind as much as it thrills.
</p>

<h4>Most Important Scene:</h4>
<h5>The Spinning Top Ending:</h5>
<p>Cobb finally reunites with his children, but the camera lingers on his spinning totem, leaving viewers questioning reality.</p>

<h5>Quote:</h5>
<p>"What is the most resilient parasite? An idea. Resilient... highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate." - Cobb</p>
