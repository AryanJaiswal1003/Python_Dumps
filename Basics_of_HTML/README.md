## Understanding HTML Headings, Paragraphs, and Void Elements

# 1. HTML Headings (<h1> to <h6>)

Headings are used for titles and subtitles in a webpage. They go from <h1> (biggest/most important) to <h6> (smallest/least important). 
    <h1> is usually the main title of the page.

You should only use one <h1> per page for clarity and SEO (search engine optimization).

    # Example:

        <h1>Main Title of the Page</h1>
        <h2>Section Heading</h2>
        <h3>Subsection Heading</h3>
        <h4>Smaller Heading</h4>
        <h5>Even Smaller</h5>
        <h6>Tiny Heading</h6>

# 2. Paragraph (<p>) Element

The <p> element is used to write paragraphs of text. Browsers automatically add some spacing above and below each paragraph, making them easier to read.

    # Example:

        <p>This is my first paragraph in HTML.</p>
        <p>Here is another paragraph with more text.</p>


--> **Tip:** Use <p> for body text, descriptions, or any normal sentences.

# 3. Void Elements (Self-Closing Tags)

Some elements don’t hold any text/content inside them. They are called void elements or self-closing tags. They don’t need a closing tag (</tag>).

    # Common Void Elements:

        a. <br> → Adds a line break (new line).

        b. <hr> → Inserts a horizontal line.

        c. <img> → Displays an image.

        d. <input> → Creates a textbox, button, or other form element.
