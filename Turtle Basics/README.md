## Turtle Graphics Projects

This repository contains two Python projects built using the Turtle Graphics library. Both projects explore creative 
drawing with colors, randomness, and geometric patterns.

## Projects Included

1. Hirst Painting (Hirst_Painting.py)
--> A Python recreation of Damien Hirstâ€™s dot paintings using Turtle graphics.

   * Generates a 10x10 grid of colorful dots.
   * Uses random colors from a predefined palette extracted from an image. 
   * Demonstrates positioning, pen control, and color usage in Turtle.

2. Basic Turtle Games (Basic Turtle_Games.py)
--> A collection of mini Turtle-based visual experiments. Includes:

   * Polygon Generator: Draws polygons from triangle (3 sides) up to decagon (10 sides) in random colors.
   * Random Walk: The turtle performs a 200-step random walk, changing direction (up, down, left, right) with random colors.
   * Spirograph: Creates a colorful circular spirograph pattern by repeatedly drawing circles and rotating slightly.
