# 🐍 My Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python projects repository!
This is where I track my progress, showcase mini-projects, and document everything I’ve learned while mastering Python programming.

## 📚 Learning Path

I’m currently learning Python as part of a structured journey that focuses on building both **core programming skills** and **practical project experience**.
My approach is:

1. **Master the Basics** → Syntax, variables, data types, loops, and conditionals.
2. **Intermediate Skills** → Functions, modules, file handling, and error handling.
3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** → Classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
4. **Advanced Topics** → Decorators, generators, and working with APIs.
5. **Applied Projects** → Building real-world tools and games.

This course has been instrumental in helping me:

* Build a **strong foundation** in Python.
* Learn **step-by-step** through daily coding challenges.
* Gain confidence with **real-world projects** from day one.
